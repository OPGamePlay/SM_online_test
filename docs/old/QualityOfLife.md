# Quality of Life Tasks
- Cinematic camera should just be a zoom in? or improved
- pick a spell should come up after tutorial
    - multiple popups and cinematic cam simulataneous is clunky, keep things simple but progressing
- ui bug: healthbar text gets blurry while hovering over push
- perk list is too wide, will overlap if you have many perks
- copy: Space needed in health potion copy
- mana goes negative if you kill yourself due to the subtracted mana from dying
- "bleed" with quantity plays 2 animations
- res markers don't show if the unit is alive but will be killed and then resurrected

## UX
- Add codex where you can read about spells and enemies
- (difficult to implement) show how much damage you'll take when you end your turn
- bug: you can zoom during cinematic
- bug: clickign to cancel cinematic sometimest clicks on the upgrade accidentally


## Graphics
- fix opening book animation playing when you don't have to wait to cast, allow it to exit early
- play opening book animation when you are viewing your inventory

## UI
- fix being able to go negative mana if you queue a spell before the previous spell's mana is spent
- A way to see your perks roll
    - Animated Perk List UI
- fix: tutorial comes up at the same time it asks you to pick a new spell
- end turn "spacebar" should flicker when you're out of mana too, not just stamina

## Content
- Way to control Ally faction units, like follow me. Or go get them.
- Enemies should spawn in discrete clusters
