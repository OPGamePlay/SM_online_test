- Release beta and test for bugs before publishing
- Update steam designation to support "remote play together"? Support local coop?
- Trailer
    - "The most creative spell-weaving game you've never heard of"
    - Make sure it's CLEAR what is going on in the trailer (don't be like StitchCraft)
    - Also make the "trailer" tom francis style where you just walk it through, doesn't have to be and should be an attempt to be "epic"
