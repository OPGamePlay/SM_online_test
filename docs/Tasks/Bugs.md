## Bugs
- Dashing to a mana potion triggers it twice
- Hotseat multiplayer still switches to dead players (see stash)
- Dead hotseat player doesn't get their turn ended
- When shooting just an arrow it shouldn't center on an enemy because it prevents a perfect directed pierce

I got two +4 capacity perks, it looks like the single turn +40 amount is being overwritten by the total of the my every level +4 capacity amount

tried doing the reverse, the +40 works normally if you take it after the +4 capacity perks. So in short...
+40 single turn perks break if you take permanent increase perks of the same resource afterwards (health/mana/stamina)
+40 single turn perks do not stack (having two of one resource only grants +40 total) could use a "does not stack" if you don't want to change this.

Howdy, I think I stumbled into an exploit. You can use **capture soul post level end** so long as there are units on the ground, IE units you control through resurrection. I was able to take resurrected units, move them around and bring them to below the hp threshold and capture 5 types. I had to "end the turn" maybe 4 times to set it all up. This was all after the level ended and it was waiting for me to walk through the portal.
