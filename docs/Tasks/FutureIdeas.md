# Ideas
- ice wall (empty unit with `immovable` to true and ice image)
- Glass axe
- Auras or growing / moving areas on the map that do damage onEndTurn
- invincible enemy that does damage that forces you to stay mobile
- an enemy that dies when all it's allies are dead
- an enemy that does more damage the more alone it is
- Mana expensive spell that gets stronger the more you use it (resets every level)
