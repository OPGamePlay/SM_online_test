# Critical Path
- Next Feature Update (v1.19)
    - Mage Classes
        - Balancing
            - Either Bloodmason spells are too cheap or stats points for health is too powerful

- v1.20
    - Upgrade server to Bun
    - Is there a way to make existing spells synergize more??
        - Special Class-specific upgrades such as "make arrow cheaper" for archer (rather than current perks)
        - Increase base damage
- Renewed Marketing Efforts
    - Post in Wholesomeverse
    - Bug Bounty?
    - Blender environment tracking to show a scene from the game in real life
- Auras
- PickaPecka spell idea: Targets units that you pass through when moving (would work well with movement spells)
- Scojbo: You could always give specific classes immediate access to a spell (like archer: arrow) and then have that spell ALWAYS cost 10.  All the sudden arrow is a decent spell, and the archer has a unique play pattern that revolves around repeated casts of a unique spell.
- Make a non-turn based gamemode where the "end turn" button becomes a "pause" button where you can still cast


# Chosen Tasks
- Desync reporter - report health, position changes and use server hub as backend
- Fix pickup desync in multiplayer
- Scobjo: balance mana steal
    - https://discord.com/channels/1032294536640200766/1032294537235812404/1132360848824877189
- Look into "Level Variety" recommendations in Discord
- bug: enemies will die before touching a pickup on multiplayer because on the server they die/move all the way immediately and on the client they don't


# Smaller Important Tasks
- Add UI for mageType
    - Test something weird happened with the poisoner where an archer was poisoned but wasn't going to die and the glop ignored it and attacked me even tho the ally archer was closer
- i18n: Add translation for touchpad move character
- Validation 7/21
    - fix: Choosing necromancer class always makes next spell fizzle because now you have too many
        - This should be fixed if you choose the necromancer class before you start - to be validated


# Ideas
- D...: Level variety https://discord.com/channels/1032294536640200766/1132253029698117672/1132253032332140695
- Idea: Totem enemies that give off auras
- Idea: Risk/reward rolling mechanic that shows the roll ("give up 5 health for potentially 20 mana")
- Idea: Spell to temporarily increase cast range for this level (or a cast range aura)
- Ideas:
    - necromancer abilities (buffing non-player units)
    - spell: Teleport arrow
    - items that increase changes of obtaining certain spells
    - Spell idea: Target for next spell that is cast (includes allies)
- Spells should use your core attributes so if you change your attributes they impact your spells. Like damage spells always use your base damage and multiply it. 
- Able to change your heroâ€™s attributes at a cost (Risk it)
- Spellmasons marketing: put sprites in real life with blender environment tracking
New trailer
- Reach out to instagram influencers
- All this after better end game and auras
- A shopkeeer where you can pay with your attributes for things 
- Feature idea: what if you can build your own "classes" that increase chances of finding things and have special buffs so you can develop unique playstyles?
    - Or what if you could "tap in" another wizard for a hard situation?
