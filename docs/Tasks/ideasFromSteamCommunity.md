I have a feeling timemason is gonna be a curse related class, wherein curses like decay or poison is going to deal more damage in less time, or like cast two ticks of damage in one round instead of two.

I think that one thing that this game is missing a little bit of is that rogue-like randomness that comes with artifacts. Think slay the spire, monster train, binding of Isaac, etc.

Or perhaps a curse that will let you use health as mana if the mana cost goes over. Though the health cost should be at a multiplied cost to reduce how OP that would be.

It's a little jarring to me, but hey to each their own
It would be cool to have something like a short gamemode and a long gamemode, where the short games have the difficulty spike and the long games have more levels, larger arenas, maybe more enemies? It'd help for mass appeal, that's for sure.

I understand the point of the calamities are to ensure runs eventually end, but it may be worthwhile to include lesser calamities- ones that sap max hp, mana, range or stamina rather than locking down a crucial spell. Some, myself included, might feel they honestly want to take the game to the point where every inch of the screen is full of bosses and enemies, enjoying their reward of power every now and then.

There is also maybe a reason to alternate 'calamity' levels with levelups, rather than having them be endless calamities from the moment you start getting them. Sometimes someone might be unlucky with a run, and their build stagnates into calamity- making a lack of progression from that point a foregone conclusion.

Each level, for the sake of further chaos to offset the loss of difficulty, could also have its own 'calamity' attached, such as yellow potions exploding when touched or enemy duplication every X turns, or even 'player randomly teleports each round'. Things that, while certainly capable of ending runs, won't necessarily end a run for certain if the player plays carefully enough.
---
My friends and I have played a number of games now over several sessions.  This is a thinking man's game, full of planning and people tend to wait until others make their move before they make decisions.  I wouldn't change anything about this, thinking about strategy is part of why this game is so great.

Having said that, I think the ending turn event could be tweaked.  People are still allowed to take actions and move after they've ended their turn.
And what ends up happening here is that some players don't actually end their turn when they're done and then forget about it.  We do this in case someone else accidently ends their turn too early and remembers they wanted to do something else, so we don't end our turn as a safety precaution.

The player list in the top left corner is small on my 3440x1440 screen (even less noticable tucked in the corner on an ultrawide).  So I'm probably most guilty about not ending my turn.

Anyways, I would like to see the "End Turn" button to act more like a "Ready" button that can be toggled on/off.  That way people aren't as afraid of an abrupt ending after they've ended their turn while in the middle of doing something they forgot to do.  They could just "unready".
Also, if we could get a subtle sound (not loud or obnoxious) when people ready/unready.  And if we could get flashy/red text to pop up at the top or bottom of the screen that says something like "last player to ready up" or something I think that could really help the game keep moving.
Finally, if we could see each players' health, stamina, and mana that'd be good too.  If you see everyone's all out of stamina and mana it's clear everyone's done.  I personally wouldn't mind that information in the top left larger in general.  Perhaps if we hover over their names we can see little icons what spells they've learned, that might be pretty nice.

This could save us a lot of time from sitting around assuming a player is still thinking about possible moves.

Pandize — Today at 12:05 AM
So it works! I do enjoy calamity, but it being the only thing and scaling so heavily really make it rough.

You can always have a "curse" for the player, but there should be a natural gain in difficulty as well.

References are always amazing to think about here;
Risk of Rain 2
Gunfire Reborn
Slay the Spire
HELLCARD
Inscryption

These games all have "infinite" difficulty. They each do scaling in their own ways. Slay the Spire, HELLCARD, and Inscryption are pretty similar though. They introduce new curses each run you complete, but they reward you with more "cards and xp".

This game isn't roguelite (yet) so doing better and getting further doesn't reward you anything. If there was a reward for getting through calamity x5 or something, then it'd be worth the attempt. (achievments wouldn't be enough for most).

So to make it work in a roguelike scenario for Spellmasons, you'd probably wanna look towards Risk of Rain. They increase enemy count, damage, HP, and start introducing "elite" versions of each enemy. Basically just a recolor with a lil glow/icon for it. From elites that provide invisibility auras, to malachites that spit spike traps as they move around.

They don't introduce all the elites at once, they first give it to the lower enemies, and as time goes on, they add it to the harder enemies. Elites could fit in Spellmasons I think.
https://discord.com/channels/1032294536640200766/1047178504267112460/1090122780068020304
Also, may not be a bad idea to introduce the Roguelite genre here and make the new spells "unlockable"

HPStarr — Today at 7:57 AM
I think you could make it so that the calamities are tied to specific enemy types (priests cannot be targeted by target similar/ect) and it would do something similar while feeling a lot better for players
maybe bundle it in with a hp buff as well
so you have >x enemy is unaffected by y spell and gains z hp/damage/stamina
---
scojbo — Today at 3:40 PM
So, I finally got a group of friends to play and I gotta say the game feels great right now. However, it is EASIER than it used to be, because flat scaling mana means you ramp to 80 or 100 mana faster than you previously did.  It means that with a couple of players its ezpz to chokepoint and control the entire map with a few well placed AOE's.

The real difficulty comes after the spell mason when cataclysms happen. But even then it feels a bit off, because the difficulty more stems from your own restrictions than from the enemies themselves. I know someone else suggested some enemy-buff cataclysms which would be great!

My suggestion is to add a couple new categories of enemies to the game.  Perhaps some fragile, immobile towers than would shoot all players from literally anywhere on the map (but very low damage).  Or other towers that drain you for 10% of your mana per turn until destroyed.  This would incentivize more proactive play.
Or maybe some enemies that gave boosts to other enemies in a zone around them while they are alive? Like movement buffs, or anti-crowd-control buffs?  This would make multiplayer a lot more engaging because players could specialize towards safeguarding the team from specific threats.  Currently, I use the same combo in every room because every enemy handles the same way (pull them into a big group and AOE them all at once).  It would be awesome if specific enemies encouraged different tactics!

Once again, I just want to say I love the game as is, please understand this criticism is not a rebuke. I've bought this game for 5 of my friends cuz its incredible!
---
HPStarr — Yesterday at 4:33 PM
It would be cool having calamities which either buff enemies, or add more of them
---
MuditaMan — Yesterday at 8:15 PM
It would be cool to have different options to change your run before you start. I have a specific idea in mind for multiplayer: players cannot find spells that others already have.

Could include other things that make the run easier, harder or just different: 1hp only, no perks, spell costs don't go back down until level completion, one free reroll for spell selections, spell type x increased costs, spell type y reduced costs, etc.

The main idea is just to have some modifiers you can choose to change a run. If these are created it should be something you can see if you join someone else's lobby (preferably before you even join).
---
Bee

To finish off it would not be fair to only give the positives, so here are a few things I think would make the game a little better.

    More enemies or a few more alternate versions
    The ability to in the future(because i'm sure this isn't easy) to fuse spells. Maybe not infinitely, but like an upgrade of some sort. An example might be fuse freeze and bloat. When the enemy dies it shoots out shards of ice.
    Please add more elemental spells like fire, water and earth stuff. Push and pull kind of already feel air. Fire could be like a burn effect similar to poison, but different.
    Friendly units need better logic. They aren't as good as the enemies and do not fight as well. Sometimes they just walk into walls or run away from the fight for some reason. Other units will choose not to fight, mostly the ranged units.
---
HPStarr — Yesterday at 10:43 PM
I have to say, the base on this game is one of the best I've ever seen, the spell mechanics are amazing. I'm really excited to see where this game goes in the next couple of months
anyway, time for some ideas:
custom map editor: 
it would be amazing having a custom map editor where people can upload maps to the workshop and make their own campaigns
bosses: I wouldn't be surprised if you're already planning this, but having bosses more interesting than the current "boss" enemies, maybe special levels every 5-10 levels where you fight one of a few bosses. (although honestly the deathmason already kind of fills this role, anyway more things like them)
enviroment: 
having things in the environment that interact with spells would be cool, eg: water that turns poisonous if you cast targeting it, crumbling walls that can be destroyed, bridges across lava that can be broken
items: having less power coming from just "getting a bigger mana pool" and instead being able to find items with more unique effects would be cool.
HPStarr — Yesterday at 10:51 PM
enemies: 
It would be cool if there were more complex enemies. Ones which buff other enemies, ones where they only move every other turn, ones that change the player's position on attack
there's already several interesting ones, but there's so much room for more
spells: more interesting damage spells would be nice. The current damage spells are all >targets one enemy and does x effect
some spells which target in an aoe, or lightning that chains by base, or maybe a dash spell that damages enemies you move through
HPStarr — Yesterday at 11:07 PM
area denial based enemies would be really good for adding variety
maybe a slime that leaves toxic sludge where it walks or something like that
there's a lot of different concepts, but this type of thing, or enemies that have on death effects
would help a lot
since atm it feels like the best strategy is always just
>hide behind a wall
>take out every enemy that can lob over walls
>push or displace any melee enemies tanky enough to get close
which on that note makes me think
some enemies being designed to counter specific strategies would be interesting
like idk, a metal golem that's really slow but can't be teleported/pushed
again though, I am super excited to see how this game develops
I can easily see this being one of my favorite rouge-likes in a few months

 AlbrechtWM [has Spellmasons] 20 hours ago
    
A few balance feedback items
Spells generally seem well costed for what they do.

However the following 3 from what ive seen could use some attention.

1) Poison at 20 mana seems rather steep for a 10 point DoT considering the other options on the table. I would either lower the mana cost to 15 or 10, or increase the damage.

2) Contaminate seems very steep at 50 mana for spreading debuffs, considering the wealth of 20 point targetting spells. I would consider lowering it's cost

3) Targetting Column. Its to narrow and short at 20 mana compared to Cone, Connect, Circle, and other targetting spells at the same mana cost. Either reduce its cost to 15 or increase it's width and/or preferably length (cone is both wider and longer than column for example)

That's it. Noticed some UI/refresh bugs I might also report if they haven't been brought up yet.

Having a lot of fun so far! 
---
A couple observations from my broken run earlier depicted in General:

1) The spell that sacrifices your health to steal mana from enemies has no limit to the amount of mana it can take from enemies, and will take more mana than the enemy has to give if stacked. I was able to achieve over 15k mana by sacrificing all my health with an AoE spam of this spell. Suggestion : this spell needs to be limited to the amount of mana an enemy has to offer.

2) A lengthy spell will continue to cast even after the targeted enemies are dead. It will continue to link to dead enemies that were killed during that same spell resulting in lengthy animation of connections to once alive (now dead) enemies. The same spell continued to cast when entering the next floor, and because I cast blood curse and a ton of heals on all of us, killed my teammates when the spell finally culminated even though we had moved onto the next floor. Suggestion : If a spell contains offensive (or defensive) components, have that spell end if all targets that will be hurt / helped have already died. ( no reason to continue to connect to a mass pile of bodies, or cast fortify on a dead teammate).  Also, have any and all spell effects in progress end when moving to the next floor.

3) When casting an ungodly amount of arrows, the arrows take a very, very long time to shoot. (the developer has already commented on speeding this up) and will continue to shoot after all enemies have died. (this loops back into the last point)
J'in — Today at 5:26 AM
4) When splitting your teammates, they have no control over the split versions of themselves. Not sure if this is intended as the stage ended before we could test this further so I'm not sure if they have auto AI controlling them or what that situation is. Either way I am fine with this as it is funny to me. However, when moving to the next floor, that teammate was still split and still had reduced stats, but none of his little off shoots came with us. This is a pretty big issue for progression. Suggestion : either have split units merge back together on progression to next floor, or have split units come along and spawn with the player when they choose their location.
5) When queueing an absolutely massive amount of spells, it still displays every icon on everyone's screen leading to some pretty blocked views of the map. Suggestion : Have the spell box be limited to a certain amount of icons that each player can then click on ( like an interactable corner) that then expands to the full view and can be collapsed again.

 Passed level 22 - what's next? (and some feedback)
I'm now curious if it makes any sense to continue. Is the game ever designed for such experience? I have 20k health in particular and can summon armies so large that my PC is dying while animating them.


Also some feedback so far:

- I've already mentioned that me and AI can summon very big armies and my PC barely can handle that, we probably need an option to disable animations if nothing really limits army size

- similarly I once used Circle + 8 x Arrow (or similiar) and animation took several minutes for this spell (faster if ALT-TAB out of the game, but still too long)

- need to have more than 1 row for spells, it's not friendly to swap spells from the book, unless it's somehow linked to game mechanics

- it's hard to notice scroll appearance - it may be even out of sight or hidden by units, what's about a message or something?

- Fortify 0.1% - this is the only spell so far I don't get. I need to cast it 100 times to block 10% of damage? It's not funny.

- what's about reordering spells in the casting row? like with drag&drop

- Saves... It's good there are saves, but some usability still needed. Stop... Isn't it roguelike? Why DO we have saves? What's about auto-save? Problem solved.

- screen scrolling speed may be needs to be configurable (I'm not using middle button)


- there should be balance issues too, but since I don't even know what to expect... For examplewhen I have 20k health Shield +30 is useless. Hordes of archers summoned by enemy are useless too. Well, they give me lot of potions of course...

Chris:
"balance: Remove Nullify spell because it was way too powerful in the endgame (I may rethink a way to reintegrate it later)"

I've got a couple worked out thoughts on fixing its balance. Hopefully you like one of them! I believe each of these solutions addresses the problem with the previous version of Nullify but in a different way.

A) Nullify no longer works on the caster, but functions identically to before with regards to enemies and other allies

B) Nullify is split into 2 component spellcards: 
Steadfast - a spell that works like Nullify but only with regards to movement/displacement effects like Pull, Push, Displace, Repel, Vortex. 
Nullify (Stackable) - a spell that only nullifies the next forged damaging component in the same spell it is in. It has to be inside the spell combo to nullify an effect and it only nullifies 1 forged effect (ignoring Targeting components of course). Nullify will only protect against 1 single component in Stacked damages like Rend. 
So if there were Nullify - Nullify - Target:Circle - Rend - Rend - Rend, The caster would take damage from Rend as if they were only hit by a single Rend. Enemies would take damage from 3 Rends.

C) Nullify works as before, but cannot protect the caster against damage that would (if not protected) be at or above their max HP. 
I.E Nullify will protect against a single spell's damage to a caster with 60HP if and only if the damage is 59HP or less. If it is 60HP or more, Nullify fails entirely.
---
J'in
I think a possible solution for the summoner issue would be to have them summon X creature but with no mana so they have to build up their mana and cant immediately summon more enemies. It would at least buy the player some time to take care of the crowds before more are spawned in

---
Bardcore
When performing an elaborate mana steal chain, it will only let me cast spells up to my pre-mana steal amount, not respecting the mana I've gained during the spell chain from mana steal
which is obviously frustrating, because even with all my extra mana, I cannot recreate this targeting chain to now use my stolen mana
---
Blacklotis — Today at 1:58 PM
I have enjoyed the core game loop thus far.  The following suggestions are not in any particular order and all revolve around my experience playing the game solo.

1.  There is no way to tell in game how well I'm doing (or not).  A breakdown of runs, and the spells chosen that run would do a LOT towards enabling better spell decisions.  A leaderboard could solve this problem nicely if you could select that run and see a breakdown of how it went (Damage per level, number of times each spell was used, number of times each spell chain was used, etc etc.)  To be more complete, a sortable database of all runs.

2.  Enemy movement is about as simple as it can possibly be (and quite boring after about an hour of play).  Enemies know your position at all times and run blindly towards it.  Archers specifically suffer from this as they run towards you.....but then just stand still.  There have been a number of situations where I was able to recover over the course of 4-5 turns in a corner when all but the archers were dead.  This mechanic just feels bad.  More intelligent pathing would radically improve the experience.  A damage balancing pass might be required with this change.

3.  The level design is okay but could be significantly improved.  Adding doors and a sound based aggro system could significantly expand the potential for more complex fights.  Spells like suffocate could have an extra ability that silences the enemy until it dies, preventing them from crying out.

4.  Lava doesn't kill enemies.....wtf?

5.  More items!  Would be interesting to push a barrel of some flammable liquid towards a group and make it go boom, setting things on fire as they ran away 🙂  If you have ever played the Divinity games you can imagine how clever environment based mechanics can get.

- mana steal should be able to extend usable mana mid-chain

Chris:
Split priests, summoners, and dark summoners should summon weaker units if they are split (currently they are unable to act at all if split)
---
Cocopuffminer3 — Today at 1:03 PM
Maybe for the later feature updates, you can add a run customizer, room sizes, enemy difficulty, stat modifiers, enemy count, etc

These things could be added as a menu after you press play to give a bit more customization
---
Omni — Today at 5:39 PM
-As I think mentioned before Split hard counters priests and dark summoners too well.

-Using Target Kind/Similar + Connect in alternating fashion is :chefkiss: for targeting the entire map regardless of enemy location. 

-1 use of Vortex tries its best to pull every target to the center point, this in tandem with room wide targeting creates very powerful impact forces to targets on the other side of walls (essentially for 1 single vortex it simulates powers equivalent to multiple push/pull). I love it, but maybe its working too well. 

-Swap is easily the most broken grouping tool when used with multi targeting combos. Its the superior and more consistent version of vortex in my opinion. I love it.

-Potions in general feel very lackluster. They can come in clutch in some early gameplay or for people learning the game for the first time, but by stage 10+ I feel they are nearly negligible. This might feel better in multiplayer, but for solo I didn't find them very necessary. Could be cooler design if potions were on a timer like scrolls, but added a very small amount of permanent mana/health/stamina (maybe 1-2%). Would give more agency to them at all stages of play, though potions generated through Living Will would likely need to not do this or be changed to prevent abuse.

-Not sure if this is intended, but once you obtain every spell it appears you no longer gain talent upgrades at the beginning of each stage.

-Sometimes when doing room wide calculations involving multiple movements (such as grouping multiple enemies with bloat and detonating them), the pre-calculations can sometimes be wrong. My assumption is the calculation doesn't always factor in travel time for some of the pulls/vortex, resulting in some enemies that would have died actually surviving because the detonation went off before the mob was pulled in range during its travel. Not a big deal honestly, just food for thought when dealing with multi-target bloat explosions.
 
-Mana scaling per stage in general feels almost a little too powerful for talents. While chance based talents feel too unreliable. A cool Idea could be to add cards that give/add weights to various spell schools. Such as maybe "Movement Specialization" gives you a selection of 3 movement spell only. Or maybe some cards interact with spells/combos, such as a talent that gives a little bit of health/stamina/mana back on cast, with higher values based on how long of a combo cast you did. This could yield some nice interactions where you could move, cast, move, cast. Or even maybe a talent like "Deal an additional 10 damage to all targets of a combo for every 30 mana spent in the combo".  Sorry kinda popping off with ideas.

-Multiple stacks of Debilitate are multiplicative. 1 stack is double damage, 2 stack is Quadra damage, 3 stack is Octa damage. Not sure if its intended, but extremely powerful. 
---
Omni — Today at 12:24 AM
Could maybe adjust it so that the targets under blood curse also take damage equal to ~20% x stacks of their maxhp per turn or something to prevent abuse. So after ~5x stacks its an auto kill from full hp. Though one could argue this starts to compete with how Suffocate is designed to play out.
Jordan - Spellmasons Developer — Today at 11:52 AM
Well there aren't any enemies that heal at the moment, so wouldn't that still just make you practically invincible so long as you don't accidentally heal yourself?
Omni — Today at 3:01 PM
If it does % MaxHP per turn as damage, it puts an effective timer on your life. Yes, you may be near invincible while you have multiple stacks, but without being able to heal and losing % max hp per turn, you will eventually die. 

That's why I think it competes with Suffocate a little bit, which I personally think may need to be balanced more. Its not particularly easy to stall X amount of turns, or rather I think there is a lack of stall supporting spells if that was the intent behind suffocate. Freeze/Slow/Shield/Heal/Fortification/Decoy are the main ones that come to mind. I think most of these are ok, just in later 10+ stages even when I do multiple stacks of suffocate a lot still say like "13 turns" which sounds super obnoxious to try and stall for that many turns. I think adding additional ways to accelerate these would be cool; maybe a unique combo with Drown that further reduces suffocate stacks, or enemies that receive liquid damage further reduce stack counts.

Lancelot — Today at 12:16 AM
Mana steal should be a percentage of life cost, we just went in a game and we were like at 160000hp and nothing did resist us.
---
Sparkle — 02/05/2023 9:30 PM
I think I need to rethink the suggestion
So, maybe instead of having different entries for +2% mana capacity +2% cast range and +8% health, it'd look cleaner and easier to gauge what's needed if it looked like:

Perks
Current
+208% health capacity
+96% mana capacity
+80% cast range
(not actual numbers, just an example of what the current bonuses applied to that current level. These numbers equal the flat %increase + the perpetual %increase per level)

Every Level
+32% health capacity
+8% mana capacity
+10% cast range

Every turn
20% chance +20% health
30% chance +20% mana
30% chance +20% mana 
(assuming those 30% chances are rolled separately)
---
Omni — Yesterday at 4:49 PM
I realize now though that bloodcurse stacking could be broken in tandem with purify since it can remove all your curses. Since you could just purify on the turn it "would" kill you otherwise and still feel nearly immortal by using/cleansing bloodcurse in a skillful way
Omni — Yesterday at 10:05 PM
-**Another potential idea you could do with blood curse is have stacks increase the afflicted persons damage, but still make healing hurt them; as well as make them take increasing amounts of damage per turn (similar to poison). Almost like a bloodlust/berserk where it forces them to kill fast or die trying. So if a vampire tags you, you are put on a timer to kill the rest of the room faster.**

-Another idea that I thought of thinking about interactions with stacks could be a spell that increases/doubles/reduces the curses on a target. Essentially the opposite of purify. Could be a great way to interact and affect Poison/Freeze/Bloat/Debilitate/Split/Bloodcurse/Suffocate

Also sorry for all the ideas, either way the game is a ton of fun and I hope you take care of yourself with all the development and work you put into this!

AnGeK — Today at 1:32 PM
Hey it's just my opinion, and ofc I imagine you're busy bug fixing. But if you got time for content i think. Your main goal should be a End boss for making it a real rogue like. And you could make difficulty level, and as reward we would get a customisation item for our mages our even finishing a whole run would unlock for our account a new spell card. I think that would be a cool way to add spells. And better reward linked to the difficulty.
I'm just giving you ideas, so you get useful feedback 🙂
And I know it's important for you the bug fixing but remember everyone's playing the game still if there's glitches because we can create fun time content in multiplayer, so i think it's important to add content maybe even more than little bug fixing to keep the fan base alive.

phrieksho — Today at 10:14 AM
Gives me an idea: a rare drop of a revive potion. If a player can maneuver it to a dead ally, they come back at half health or something. Just a thought
---
Matt_97 — Today at 5:46 AM
This isn't just a balance issue, it's also a performance issue. If the player begins resurrecting summoners and dark summoners, it can easily create a stalemate that can lasts for dozens if not hundreds of turns. All the while the level is flooded with npcs, slowing the game to a crawl. By the end my FPS was dropping close to the single digits whenever the AI took it's turn.
---
Inspektor — Today at 8:50 AM
I think nerfing Manasteal would certainly be a step in a right direction and would at least make loop 2-3 way more challenging.

As I see it there are two main ways of fixing the endgame: nerfing/limiting the spells or buffing the enemies. 

You can make it so that you can only use one type of Targeting spell per cast and make the “Multiple targeting spells not combining properly” from pre 1.2.0 the way they actually combine.

 But I think it would be best to start spawning some special variants of enemies, or maybe champion versions of existing ones after first loop. Like, for example, enemies with one-time Nullify shield, or one that can only be targeted directly (immune to Targeting spells), one that gives aura of invincibility to all enemies nearby, one with absurd stats that becomes dormant after taking some amount of damage, or maybe one that has some global on death or on hit effect: damages you / depleads your manapool / silences you. 

Hope you'll find something useful in my  rambling, best of luck with further development!
---
ThatOneGuy — Today at 10:28 AM
A way to make it so your spell's automatically fill certain slots could be pretty nice, like you set up a preset before the run then as you unlock said spells, it fills them out on your lists
---
Knuckky — Today at 12:21 AM
as stated in the thread title, as I see that coop increases the health pools of enemies, their health pools are also large when resurrected. this can make them incredible meat shields and I feel it could be a little bit too powerful overall.
I would suggest that a resurrected enemy has their base health pool as though it was single player perhaps?

 Shurimoo [has Spellmasons] Feb 17 @ 3:33am
Suggestions
Having reached the point where nothing can feasibly kill me and I can kill the entire map on turn 1 with a single spellcast along with getting "no more spells to unlock" messages when I pick up scrolls I think it safe to assume I've pretty much seen all there is (unless there's some enemy that this particular seed isn't spawning? Anyway..). Very enjoyable time! Looking forward to more.

Others have noted but I'll add a voice to it: perks being multipliers on current (meaning they are exponential) is *fun* but perhaps not wise for balance. I do enjoy annihilating the map and the glory of being an ungodly powerful wizard but long-term I think that particular interaction should be removed in favor of a multiplier on some base value (and, now that I've thought of it- maybe different starting kits / stats? High-stamina melee wizard with lower cast range high hp medium mana vs current middle-road wizard with random spells vs high-mana low-stamina wizard who commands a large cast radius etc might be neat much longer-term).

For spells and enemies, I'd like to see things that affect the terrain itself. Let us make walls to block archer fire, and let us tunnel through them to circumvent enemies. As well, I'd like to have enemies capable of burrowing through walls or blinking short distances (more aggressively, rather than what summons do which is just reposition slightly further away from you). Similarly, let us make pools or fill them. Add more effects interacting with pools. Tsunami spell that can only be cast within a range of a fluid and does damage based on type? Freeze spell in area cast over liquid turns it to a solid form that can be walked over (and re-melted with a fire spell that is area-cast?).. maybe you already can freeze it? I didn't try, actually.

Different damage types and resistances would also be nice to see, since having Debilitate apply to all damage leaves less to really mess with (in that enemy hp is a single stat, all your damage is just a #, and debilitate then effectively divides enemy hp by some multiple depending on stacks). This works well, at least for combat, but it also means that all you have to do is find the right balance of debilitates and damage spells for your mana bar and you'll just do max damage to everything in your cast zone. I don't necessarily mind this I just think it would allow for more nuance if enemies had specific elements they were weak/strong against, and it would also open more spell design options since otherwise the only thing that differentiates damage spells ends up being their mana efficiency for the most part.

Right now, I think debilitate might be the most important spell to roll specifically to deal with elites because the mana efficiency on the dmg spells isn't all that good compared to the hp scaling on elites / later enemies. Obviously you reach a point where it's irrelevant but I found my best move was to kill enemies with impact damage +/ bloat (vortexing every enemy I could link into a giant blob so they slam into each other taking impact damage and anything too tanky to die from that dies from all the bloat explosions going off). Tbf, this is based off of one real god-run and 2 or 3 failed runs (aka only 4 runs total).

I will say that the fluids did come in quite handy during the early / mid game before I had enough mana to really do the full combo because the fluid damage meant I could vortex enemies into that instead of just relying on impact damage and also use freeze to force them to sit in it an extra turn etc. Tl;dr the fluid damage is really nice and I appreciate that mechanic, but as mentioned further up I'd like to see more interaction with it.

Semi related: Any plans on having a pure player choice run? Disable achievements or what ever if so inclined, but let the player see either the deck (or discovered deck with big "?" for cards not yet seen) and choose for themselves the starting loadout. Same thing with leveling frankly, its GG if one doesn't get nothing but mana as far as I've found.

There's a few suggestions 
Mix in some flat integer perks rather than all % based, the % becomes exponentially powerful quite quickly and though that's fun I think it would be a little more balanced if there were more choices by adding some flat buff ones, for instance, +4 to mana each level, + 5 to health each level, + 10 to stamina each level. +10 mana, + 20 health, + 50 stamina
you need an enemy that splits on death, like another type of slime, so that strategies that can target a lot of enemies straight away with a nuke can still be threatened
you need an enemy that can become invulnerable after taking a certain amount of damage, like a one turn death defiance, maybe you could add a spell that purges buffs from a target so that this would be easier to deal with

possibly reduce the amount of enemies that have mana, it can make mana steal a little bit too powerful if combined with some target similar/connect shenanigans
possibly add an enemy which makes spell that target it cost more but is relatively weak, to make AOE positioning and connections less braindead
you could add buffs to certain enemies perhaps only minibosses that cause them to be shielded from the first spell that targets them
maybe an enemy that can give allies a buff like this
I just feel that the game is very very fun at the start, and then after a certain point you can start to steamroll anything
I would like the opportunity to continue carefully planning moves and strategising multiple turns in advance for a little longer before going infinite
overall you have made a fantastic game and I have introduced 3 friends to it to play with
I will be investigating the modding side of things but I believe that some of these suggestions should be core features in my opinion

That's awesome! And I did just leave a 10/10 steam review.
 Just some food for thought that you've likely considered:

1) AOE freeze in multiplayer is wayyyy OP if multiple people get it cuz they can just trade off freezes and permafreeze.  Perhaps nerf freeze or add a cleansing effect to some minibosses? Or even just make it less likely to get spells that other players already have?

2) For per-level buffs, have you considered adding flat per/level buffs as an option? 2% mana per level is hands down the best option always, followed by 10% mana. If these were uncommon and a common "+5 flat mana / level" buff were added it would make the end game scaling feel a bit less out-of-control, and perhaps the difficulty would also be a tad less frontloaded.

3) Single-round-health and Single-round-endurance are legitimately worthless. consider removing them. Also 20% chance for bonus hp/magic/endurance just feels bad as well.
