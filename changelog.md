## 2/3/2023 Spellmasons Update v1.2.0
- fix: Overhaul unit and pickup syncronization issue.  This will address many (but not all) of the syncronization issues people have been experiencing in multiplayer

- fix: Another sync issue with "Bleed" spell causing the server to pause for 10 seconds
- fix: Connect prioritizing the wrong unit / pickup / corpse connections

- UX: Limit length of multiplayer thought bubbles so they don't cover too much space if an ally is casting a large spell

- feature: Re-enable Loading saved games in Multiplayer
    - Note: This feature is still a little clunky if you are rejoining a save where the same players are not present.  It allows you to assume control of a different player character while in the lobby if, for example, you were to load your save game on another computer or with different friends than you saved it with.
    - I expect Loading multiplayer saved games may not work perfectly, but I put it back in so people can atleast try it.  Please let me know in Discord if you encounter any issues with it

- Quality of Life
    - Increase speed of high quanity arrows so the spell animation doesn't last too long

- i18n: Add support for 中文(简) zh-CN and 中文(繁) zh-TW.  Thank you Cie from our Discord Community
